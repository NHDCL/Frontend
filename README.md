Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL) Facility Management System.

## Purpose

To provide a centralized, digital platform for managing assets, maintenance, and operations across 300+ buildings in Bhutanâ€™s Gyalsung Academies.

## Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture, with separate repositories for each core service:

- **Frontend:** Built with React.js, offering responsive UI/UX for users, managers, technicians, and admins.
- **Backend:**  Developed using Spring Boot (Java), handling authentication, business logic, and data services.
- **Database:** MongoDB, storing structured asset and user data.
- **API Gateway:** Secure routing of requests with role-based access.
- **(Add other services as needed, e.g., Mobile App, Notification Service, etc.)**

Each service is developed, deployed, and maintained independently for scalability and flexibility.
