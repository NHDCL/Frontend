# NHDCL Facility Management System

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the National Housing Development Corporation Limited (NHDCL) Facility Management System.

## Purpose

To provide a centralized, digital platform for managing assets, maintenance, and operations across 300+ buildings in Bhutanâ€™s Gyalsung Academies.

## Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture, with separate repositories for each core service:

- **Frontend:** React.js web application for user interaction, asset tracking, and maintenance requests.
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express.js REST API handling business logic, authentication, and data storage.
- **(Add other services as needed, e.g., Mobile App, Notification Service, etc.)**

Each service is developed, deployed, and maintained independently for scalability and flexibility.

- [nhdcl-backend](https://github.com/NHDCL/nhdcl-backend): API and business logic.
